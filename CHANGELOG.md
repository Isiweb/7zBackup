## Unreleased

- Code: The help and log header link to the new repository address https://github.com/AndreaLanfranchi/7zBackup

## 2.1.5-Stable (2026-09-12, Anlan)

- Bug: Move and clear archive bit acted also on files 7-Zip failed to store. Processed items are now read from the finished archive
- Bug: With nofollowjunctions, folders enumerated after a skipped junction could be silently left out of the scan
- Bug: Rotation could delete archives of other jobs sharing the prefix end or renamed copies. Archive name regex is now anchored
- Bug: matchcleanupfiles tested an undefined variable: cleanup never ran, or deleted every file with a regex matching empty text. Cleaned files were archived
- Bug: A refused run deleted the running instance's lock file and stale locks were never detected. Locks are now checked by process id and start time
- Bug: Selection exceptions (e.g. access denied) were never logged nor counted as warnings: their writer used an undefined variable
- Bug: 7-Zip warnings (missing or unreadable files) were never logged nor counted: the match expected drive paths. Items are now matched against the catalog
- Bug: Selection file directives maxfilesize, minfilesize, maxfileage, minfileage, compression, threads and solid were ignored. File ages accept integers
- Bug: With a lowercase work drive letter subfolder paths became absolute: the archive lost its folder structure and path directives stopped matching
- Bug: Work drive check never ran (a parameter binding error aborted it) and its NTFS test was inverted
- Bug: Links with spaces or square brackets in the alias were not removed at cleanup but reported as removed: the root dir and its links stayed on disk
- Bug: Notification addresses: valid ones (a@x.com, name+tag@, 1user@) were rejected, invalid ones were not reported and still used. Now warned and dropped
- Bug: A failed notification email showed an empty reason: now the underlying error
- Sec: The archive password was visible in the process list and verbose output: it now goes to 7-Zip input. 7-Zip console charset is UTF-8
- Bug: Archive prefix accepted path separators (e.g. ..\x): the archive could be written outside the destination path. Now rejected
- Bug: Post archive statistics: files/sec was always 0 (undefined variable) and the progress percent went over 100, hiding the progress bar
- Bug: Pre-Vista junctions: Make-Junction passed an undefined target and Remove-Junction had a broken Start-Sleep call
- Bug: Logged real paths were wrong when a folder name contained the alias, and the nofollowjunctions log named the parent instead of the skipped junction
- Bug: Scan counted one folder too many (extra call without a folder) and the empty Compress-Detail.txt was added to the archive (misspelled name filter)
- Bug: Log messages printed ".Exception.Message" and ".Name" literally, and a 7-Zip command line error printed an undefined variable instead of the arguments
- Bug: Directive names matched longer names (prefixes=, includesourcex=, ...): the regexes used =* (zero or more =)
- Bug: Size and age checks never ran: invalid maxfilesize, minfilesize, maxfileage and minfileage values were silently ignored. Now they stop the job with an error
- Bug: A size or age value of 0 stayed set (removal missed the script scope): the log listed a 0 bytes or 0 days filter that did nothing
- Bug: An invalid smtpuser / smtppass pair was reported but kept: the error email could authenticate with a blank password
- Code: Help for --clearbit said FULL or DIFF clear the Archive attribute: FULL or INCR
- Code: Removed unused functions Clear-FsAttribute and Pause and other dead code
- Code: PostArchiving removed BkCompressDetailItems from the wrong scope (had no effect)
- Feat: Selected items missing from the archive and not reported by 7-Zip are now logged as NOT ARCHIVED warnings, for every backup type
- Bug: Clearing the Archive bit failed on files with other attributes (e.g. OneDrive, issue #13) and silently did nothing on names with square brackets
- Feat: New --mailkitpath: MailKit and its dependencies are loaded from that folder at startup (issue #14). If loading fails, a warning is logged and SmtpClient is kept
- Feat: Notification emails are sent with MailKit when --mailkitpath is set (issue #14). Port 465 uses TLS on connect, --smtpssl requires STARTTLS on other ports
- Bug: A sender given as an array (e.g. @(...) in the vars file) passed the check, but the email failed: the joined value was a local copy, the script kept the array
- Bug: The relay (--smtpserver) given as an array had the same problem: the joined value was checked, the array was used
- Speed: Scan progress is updated at most every 500 ms: Write-Progress took milliseconds per call and the scan called it 3 times per folder
- Speed: Paths built once per file use [IO.Path]::Combine instead of Join-Path (90 to 3 us)
- Speed: PostArchiving deletes and clears files with .NET calls, not Get-Item / Remove-Item (about 360 to 65 us per file), and keeps listing entries as plain strings
- Speed: File age filters subtract dates instead of calling New-Timespan per file, and the NOT ARCHIVED check loops over the catalog instead of piping it
- Speed: Selection statistics are summed during the scan: Catalog-Stats.csv and its Import-Csv / Group-Object pass (about 36 us per file) are gone
- Bug: 7-Zip output was read by PowerShell events: lines came out of order, stderr lines were joined into one and lines still queued when 7-Zip exited were lost
- Speed: Folders are listed with DirectoryInfo instead of Get-ChildItem (about 27 to 1 us per item)
- Code: Get-CimInstance instead of Get-WmiObject, which PowerShell 7 does not have
- Feat: Local sources are linked with junctions, which need no admin rights. Network sources (UNC paths, network drives) still get symbolic links
- Bug: While 7-Zip wrote the archive, progress read its size from the folder listing, which lags for open files: it kept showing "Waiting for archive ..."
- Bug: The log numbered selection exceptions one above their id in Selection-Excpt.csv
- Bug: A cleanup folder that could not be removed wrote System.Object[] in Selection-Excpt.csv. Now it writes the first error and the real path of the folder
- Bug: A cleanup file that could not be removed was written in Selection-Excpt.csv with its path through the root dir link, removed after the job: now its real path, as in the log
- Bug: Cleanup files and folders that could not be removed for access denied were logged as ArgumentException (PowerShell 5.1 Remove-Item): .NET deletes now name the real error. Read-only flags are cleared first
- Code: Full cmdlet names (Where-Object, Select-Object, Sort-Object) instead of the aliases ?, select and sort
- Code: Functions renamed to approved verbs: Invoke-PostAction, Test-CtrlCRequest, Test-FsAttribute, New-Junction, New-SymLink, Assert-Arguments, Assert-Variables (were Do-, Check-, Make-, Validate-)

- Code: Inserted by default /accepteula switch for junction.exe

## 1.7.3-Stable (2010-12-07, Anlan)

- Bug: Routine Clear-FsAttribute rewritten due to errors by by cmdlet Get-Item while handling long paths with many escape chars (like brackets and so on ...)

## 1.5.7-Stable (2010-01-14, Anlan)

- Bug: Wrong encoding in 7-Zip output causes incorrect translation on file names therefore making impossible for the script to go and clear "A" attribute on it. Solved by encoding in UTF8 output from 7-Zip
- Ui: Statistics on selection now include Absolute and Increasing percent of overall file sizes

## 1.5.6-Stable (2010-01-13, Anlan)

- Bug: Incorrect assumption on Clear Archive Bit logic. The clearing of archive bit is executed on FULL or INCR backups. This is not correct. *It should be on FULL or DIFF backups*

## 1.5.5-Stable (2010-01-11, Anlan)

- Bug: Late clearing of archive bit after compression may fail if the file does not exist anymore. In addition the list of selected files has been encoded in UTF8 to allow selection of file names with accented letters.

- Bug: The clearing of archive bit did not work.

## 1.5.3-Stable (2010-01-01, Anlan)

- Minor Fixes: $totalBytes strongly typed to [int64]
- Get-ChildItem in ProcessFolder now with -ErrorAction Stop

## 1.5-Stable (2009-12-29, Anlan)

- --workdir switch has been dismissed
- To prevent the occurrence of PathTooLong Exception as much as possible now the script will generate a short randomly named directory in the root of the drive specified by the --workdrive switch which has now become mandatory
- Complete rewrite of the selection process to speed it up and new directives to stop recursion and to honor (or not) junctions during scanning process

## 01.002-beta (2009-12-24, Anlan)

- Clear Archive Bit now uses Set-ItemProperty
- ProcessFolder now implements -force switch to discover hidden files
