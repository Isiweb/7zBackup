#                                                    so you can replace the script with new version/relase

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 --type        Type of backup to perform:
               full : All files and archive bit cleared after archiving
               diff : Files with archive bit set.
                      Archive bit left unchanged after backup.
               incr : Files with archive bit set.
                      Archive bit cleared after backup.					 
               copy : Same as FULL but leave archive bits unchanged
               move : All files matching selection criteria regardless
                      their Archive bit status. After succesful operation
                      archived files are deleted from their original
                      location. Use with great care.

 --selection   Full path to file containing the selection criteria

 --destpath    Full path to destination media which will contain the archive.
               Ensure it will be on a drive with sufficient space to
               contain all the data. Can be a UNC path.
                  
 --workdrive   Drive letter to use for creation of root junction point.
               If not set the script will use the drive associated to
               the TEMP environment variable. It MUST be a valid
               drive letter with the exclusion of A and B. Drive associated
               to this letter must have NTFS file system and it`'s root
               must be writable.

 --archivetype The type of archive you want to create.
               7z   : default format with better compression
               zip  : very compatible with other programs
               tar  : unix and linux compatible but only archiving (no compression)

 --compression The level of compression you want to achieve.
               Possible values are [0 | 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9 ].
               where lower values mean almost no compression and fast
               archiving while higher values mean the opposite.
               If omitted 7zip will use default settings			   

 --threads     Number of threads 7zip is allowed to use. If not set then
               7zip will try to adopt one thread per core. Set this value
               to 1 or 0 to disable multithreading.
			   
 --solid       Sets wether or not 7z archives should endorse solid format
               By default 7z archives endorse solid format. Refer to
               7-zip documentation to understand what are solid archives.

 --volumes     This command switch implements the -v switch provided by
               7-zip. You can pass a single value or a list of values
			   comma separated.
  
 --rotate      This value must be a number and indicates the number of
               archives that should remain on disk after successful
               archiving. For example if you set --rotation 3 on a 
               full archiving operation it means that the newest 3 full
               archives will be kept on disk while the oldest (if any)
               will be deleted. If this value is NOT set then ALL the
               generated archives will be kept on disk. Please be advised
               that in such case your target media will be likely get
               out of space soon. It can be specified either as command argument,
               or in the hardcoded vars file, or in the selection file. 

 --maxdepth    This value si a zero-based index limiting the depth of recursion
               while scanning in search of files to backup. Valid values are
               positive integers. It can be specified either as command argument
               or in the hardcoded vars file, or in the selection file.

 --clearbit    In backup operations of type FULL or DIFF the Archive attribute
               of backupped files is cleared. If you do not want the script
               to do this simply pass --clearbit False. On the other hand
               if you do want to clear the attribute even in other backup
               types then pass --clearbit True

 --emptydirs   By design an archive will hold only files, not directories.
               Therefore the script will simply not find anything to backup
               in an empty directory. If you wish the archive to have the
               indication of empty directories also simply enable this switch.
               It will drop a dummy placeholder file in the empty dir therefore
               allowing the compressor to select it.
               This is a switch argument
 
 --password    Use this switch if you want to password protect your
               archive. No spaces in passwords please.

 --prefix      The prefix to use to generate the archive name.

 --workdir     SUPERSEDED (will be simply ignored)
               Directory which will be used as working area. 
               Must be on an NTFS file system. If none is given then
               the procedure will try to use the one in environment's
               TEMP variable.

 --7zipbin     Specify full path to 7z.exe. 
               If the argument is not provided the script will try to
